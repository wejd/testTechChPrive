# Loyalty front-end page

This project stands for the front-end of our application, where one can check a user's loyalty information, 
and possibly other loyalty-related data.

It's a simple React application built with `create-react-app`.

Requirements:
- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) or node 8.12

## Installation
``` bash
(optional) > nvm use
> npm install
```

## Launch tests
``` bash
> npm test
```

## Start server
``` bash
> npm start
```

## Notes

* A back-end API must be running on port 8000 for the page to display correctly (ie: [api url usage](fullstack-developper/front/src/Rider.js:5)). 
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to check the provided example page, which is not really functional...
